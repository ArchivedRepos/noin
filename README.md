#NoIndent
Command line utility that moves all the inline scripts in an .html file and put them into their own .js files. It then replaces the inline scripts with script tags linking to the newly created .js files.
Put together for csp testing purposes. It's pretty simple code, but was thrown together quickly and not thourougly tested. Use at your own risk.
